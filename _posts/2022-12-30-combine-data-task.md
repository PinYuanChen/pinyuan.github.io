Recently I was playing with Combine and I kind of liked its syntax. Combine offers plenty handy operators to handle asynchronicity, making the processing of URL task results looks elegant. If you are new to Combine, I highly recommend you to read the [official document](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlsession/processing_url_session_data_task_results_with_combine) about processing URL task results. It covers many useful APIs and explains them in a succinct way. I want to share some of my experiences on dealing with `dataTaskPublisher` results.

At the early stages of development, it's common for the backend server to be unfinished. So, how can app developers create tests for network requests in these situations? Furthermore, even with a functioning server, unstable network conditions can lead to inconsistent test results and longer test durations, potentially slowing development. How can we tackle these challenges while still ensuring robust testing for our apps?

As to the first question, the answer is "YES". Even without a complete server, you can still craft tests to assess various scenarios using networking frameworks like URLSession, Alamofire, and others. As per Apple's testing guidelines presented in [WWDC]('https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018/417'), our test suite should resemble a pyramid. At its base are numerous unit tests, followed by a smaller set of medium-sized integration tests, and capped off with a select few end-to-end tests.

According to Apple's description,

These(Unit tests) are characterized by being simple to read, producing clear failure messages when we detect a problem, and by running very quickly, often in the order of hundreds or thousands of tests per minute.
